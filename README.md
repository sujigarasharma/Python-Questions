# Python Questions

BMI_Calculation

A person wants to know his Body Mass Index (BMI). He knows his weight in pounds and height in inches. The evaluator knows the formula for calculating BMI using the formula, BMI = (weight in kilograms) / (height in m * height in m) Help the person in finding his BMI by writing a program for him. (Use the conversion formulae: 1 pound =0.4536 kilograms, 1 inch = 2.54 cms)


GPA_Calculation

Being a student, Bavan wants to calculate the GPA (Grade Point Average), which is calculated using the formula, Sum of product of grade obtained in each subject and its corresponding credits / total credits. Assume that the student has three subjects in the semester.


Hours_Calculation

A company wants its employees to work for 'X' hours on average per day in a week (Monday to Friday). Given the number of hours worked by an employee on each day of a week, write the Python code to compute the average number of hours worked by the employee. Number of hours worked can be floating point values. For example, 7 hours 30 minutes is entered as 7.5 hours


TotalDistance_Calculation

Use 24 hour format to solve the problem. A car moves with a speed of 'x' km/h from 'h1' hours, 'm1' minutes to 'h2' hours, 'm2' minutes and then with a speed of 'y' km/h from 'h3' hours, 'm3' minutes to 'h4' hours and 'm4' minutes. Write the Python code to determine the total distance covered by the car. For example, if x is 40, h1 is 6, m1 is 40, h2 is 7, m2 is 10 and y is 60, h3 is 7, m3 is 15, h4 is 8, m4 is 0 then the car has covered 65 km in the given time.


ATM_Currency

Assume an ATM has currency notes of denominations 100,500 and1000. If the amount to be withdrawn is input through the ATM keyboard panel, find the total number of currency notes under each denomination that the ATM has to dispense. Boundary conditions : 100 <= amount <= 100000.


Complan_health

A health drink company, say complan, give a festival offer to its retail customers. The health drink complan packed in 1 kg pack. For every 5, one kg pack purchase, one 1kg pack will be free. (i.e. buy 5 get 1 free). If the free pack exceeds or equals in the multiple of 5, for every 5, additional one 1 kg pack will be given free. Example: If a person buy 125 one kg complain pack, he get 155 one kg complain pack in his hand. If boundary conditions are not met then print the message 'Invalid input'. Boundary conditions : 0< complan pack <= 500.


Discount

Mercy electronics shop has given festival offer that is 12% off, on every purchase. Following are the prices of the electronic items. 4GB Transcend pen drive is Rs.500/-, Sony Head set is Rs 1000/-, Samsung tablet is Rs 3500/- and Seagate Hardisk 1TB is Rs 4000/-. Calculate the total bill amount to pay by doing a purchase in Mercy electronics shop. In this case, price of pendrive after discount is Rs. 440 (that is Rs.500-Rs.60). Boundary conditions All inputs >0 and less than 20.


paint_water_tank

Imagine you have asked a painter to paint the water tank which is cylindrical in shape in your house. It should be painted both on inner and outer side. The painter says, he charges Rs 0.02/- per centimeter square which includes his wage and material. Given the water tank is in of 'x' cm radius and 'y' cm height, determine the cost you should pay to the painter. Hint: The total surface area of one side of a cylinder is 2Ï€r(r+h) Boundary conditions All inputs >0.


determine_hours

Given the current time in hours (h), minutes(m) and seconds(s) and number of seconds(s1), write a python code to determine hours, minutes and seconds after s1 seconds. For example if time is given as 2, 57, 55 and seconds to add as 315 then new time will be 3 hours 04 minutes 5 seconds.


grid_player

In a fun game, MXM grid is given with full of coins. The player has to give a number 'N' of his choice. If N is lesser than M then he doesn't gain any points. Otherwise he has to place all coins of MxM grid in the N X N grid and he gains points equal to the number of free cells in the N X N grid. Input format: Dimension of grid - M Choice by the player - N Output format: number of points gained.
